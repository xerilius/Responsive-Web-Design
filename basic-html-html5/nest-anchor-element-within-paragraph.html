<!-- Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph

You can nest links within other text elements.

<p>
  Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://game-on.tk"> link to GAME-ON </a> for you to follow.
</p>

- Normal text is wrapped in the p element:
<p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p> Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):
<a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link and the value "_blank" specifies to open the link in a new tab href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:
<a href="http://game-on.tk"> ... </a> The text, "link to game-on.tk", within the a element called anchor text, will display a link to click:
<a href=" ... ">link to game-on.tk</a> The final output of the example will look like this:

Here's a link to game-on.tk for you to follow.

<!--
Now nest the existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing main element). The new paragraph should have text that says "View more cat photos", where "cat photos" is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.
