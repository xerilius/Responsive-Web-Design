<!-- HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the </ol> tag.

For example:

<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".
