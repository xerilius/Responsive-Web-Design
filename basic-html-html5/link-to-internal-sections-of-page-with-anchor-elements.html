<!-- Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements

a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link:
- assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. 
- Need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. 
- An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>

When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Notes:
    target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab
