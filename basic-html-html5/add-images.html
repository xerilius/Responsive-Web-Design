Add Images to Your Website 

You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

An example of this would be:
<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">

Note: img elements are self-closing.

All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.

Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.

<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="Author standing on a beach with two thumbs up.">
